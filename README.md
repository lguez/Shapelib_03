This is a Fortran interface to the [Shapefile C
library](http://shapelib.maptools.org). `Shapelib_03` is currently
built as a wrapper of the [fortrangis
library](https://github.com/ARPA-SIMC/fortrangis), which already
contains a Fortran interface to the shapefile C library. So
`Shapelib_03` is an alternate Fortran interface, meant to be
friendlier and more secure.
